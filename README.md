# Hand-Written Digit Classifier

Here is a simple neural network architecture to recognise hand-written digits based of the famous MNIST dataset

## 1. About the dataset



The training image are 28 x 28 pixels, 784 pixels in total. Since images are greyscaled, each pixel ranges from 0 to 255. 255 means white, 0 means black.
